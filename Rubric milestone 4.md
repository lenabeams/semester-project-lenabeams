G. Self Evaluation Questions (half point each):

How much time did you spend on this assignment/project? Hard to say because it has been broken up into 4 parts, but all together i think i have spent approx 23-25 hours or so on this? maybe more, maybe less.  

How difficult did you feel this project was? Easy, moderate, difficult? I found alot of difficulty in styling this project, i wasnt sure exactly what direction to take it, and implementing things and having them go with the mood was also difficult. I really liked being able to style things how i wanted and have the layout how i liked. I found it moderate, putting all the skills i have learned to the test, but still making it appealing. It was hard to get past certain milestones but i did it! Difficult parts came when i had to validate work, as well as figure out how to fix problems.

What challenges did you come across while working on this project? Implementing all i have learned and trying to make it aestheticly pleasing as well. I found it slightly hard to know what was expected of me to hand in, so i just tried my best! 
Making the layout look aesthetically pleasing came difficult to me even though i am someone who has quite a sense with making things pretty but i feel like i acouplished this after afew tweaks. 

What things would you like to learn more about after having worked on this assignment? Creating content and knowing what to write and where, also the cards in my portfolio section could use some work forsure. Styling and what extra features you could use to make things really pop!  Total Score:20/20



I have made my entire webpage look more cohesize all together. I have added buttns that are the yellow pop colour for an accent, and added a background image for my jumbotrons that bring out the colours i have chosen. I have added an arrow to suggest scrolling down to my portfolio, as it was a worry that it may get missed. I have also changed the portfolio pictures around so that they would be more similar in size with the others in its row. I have an open issue of " make all cards same size" for the portfolio section. For some reason i wasnt able to get to the bottom of why the cards werent working as i intended to like they worked on the home page. I made them a card-group so they would all span the same amount of space, but it didnt seem to work. 


I have learned alot in this course, however i did find i was spending the majority of my week primarily on this class so my other classes did suffer quite a bit. I found if i did all the assignments, videos, readings and labs i would be spending close to 15-20 hours a week. Closer to the end of the term i found i simly did not have the time to complete the labs which was rather unfortunate as i feel i would have gotten alot from them. I found the quizzes to not be an accurate representation of my knowledge i have gained with this course. I feel as though i am trying to do a puzzle when reading the questions, its really hard to understand what the questions are asking me.  I would want to change the complexity/length of the assignments- but keep the labs as they were valueable. I found there was a lot of repetition in the assignmnets that definitely could have been scaled down to allow more time to work on labs and such. Im not sure we spent enough time on sass, as it is so convoluted i find i really dont understand it much. My favorite part of the course was learning bootstrap. It is the tool i understand the most and makes the most sense in my brain :) I feel as though with using bootstrap i could tackle a project on my own with the help of the internet! 
Thank you for your time and patience teaching this difficult course !!
