G. Self Evaluation Questions (half point each):

How much time did you spend on this assignment/project? Hard to say because it has been broken up into 3 parts, but all together i think i have spent approx 20 hours or so on this? maybe more, maybe less.  

How difficult did you feel this project was? Easy, moderate, difficult? I found alot of difficulty in styling this project, i wasnt sure exactly what direction to take it, and implementing things and having them go with the mood was also difficult. I really liked being able to style things how i wanted and have the layout how i liked. I found it moderate, putting all the skills i have learned to the test, but still making it appealing. 

What challenges did you come across while working on this project? Implementing all i have learned and trying to make it aestheticly pleasing as well. I found it slightly hard to know what was expected of me to hand in, so i just tried my best! 

What things would you like to learn more about after having worked on this assignment? Creating content and knowing what to write and where, also the cards in my portfolio section could use some work forsure.  Total Score:20/20
