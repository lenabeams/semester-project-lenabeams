    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    <p>For my project, i would like it to be a website that can be used as portfolio and information site for my future business venture as a freelance graphic deisgner. </p>
    <p>The goals of my project would be to supply the user contact information with a form on a 'contact' page, previous work with description and images on an 'About' 
        page, and a 'home' page that has services offered and my approach to design.
    
    </p>

    <h3>Home Paged (landing)</h3>
       <p>The intent of this page is to feature my offered services and have a call to action button that will take the user to the contact form on the 'contact page'
        There will be a featured image of one of my works, and a blurb that will end with a button that will take you to the 'about page' to see my work. 
       </p>
    <h3>About Page</h3>
       <p>The about page will have a main content section that will contain my portfolio. My portfolio will feature images and texts in a form of a card. The aside section will have a
        picture of me as well as a little bit of information about me. 
       </p>

    <h3> Contact Page </h3>
    <p>The contact page will have a contact form that users can fill out and the 'aside' will feature at least 3 testemonials. </p>
